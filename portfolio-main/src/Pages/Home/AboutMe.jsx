                    <p>Hello! I'm Emad and I am currently a first year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, living in the GTA. I have a knack for building things with electronics and coding in my free time, as well as playing sports such as soccer and baseball and gaming. <br /><br /> I have a very diverse skillset in both software and hardware from mechanical and electrical design, to designing robust applications using various tools. <br /><br /> Despite just starting out university, I have experience in embedded systems and CAD design through being a member of UWFE at my university, and I have done plenty of cool projects.
